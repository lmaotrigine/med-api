    <h1>Token Panel for VJ's med API</h1>
    <p>This site will be dedicated to providing documentations for VJ's med API - a rudimentary service dedicated to providing a database frontend and some random fun stuff..</p>

    <h2>How do I get access?</h2>
    <p>Usage of the API requires an authentication token, which is generated and assigned by
      <span class='mention'>@VJ#5945</span>. In order to be eligible for a token, you must meet the following qualifications.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be a member of my server (
        <a href='https://discord.gg/rqgRyF8'>invite</a> ) so that I can communicate with you.</li>
      <li>You must agree to the
        <a href="terms">terms of use</a>.</li>
      <li>
        <span class="mention">@VJ#5945</span> has to somewhat know and/or trust you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I think I meet all of those!</h3>
    <p>Great! Slide into my DMs and we can chat.</p>
